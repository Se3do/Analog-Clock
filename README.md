# Analog-Clock
- Description:

This GitHub repository contains a JavaFX application for creating an interactive analog clock. The application, named "Clock," allows users to visualize the current time using a classic analog clock face, complete with hour, minute, and second hands. The clock is designed as an educational and visual demonstration of JavaFX's capabilities for building graphical user interfaces and animations.

# Key Features :
# Real-Time Clock Display

- The clock displays the current time by default, and it updates in real-time to reflect the actual time.
- The hour, minute, and second hands move continuously to show the current time accurately.

# Customizable Time:

- Users can create a ClockPane with specific hour, minute, and second values, allowing for custom time displays.

# Interactive Animation:

- The clock's animation is handled by JavaFX's Timeline and KeyFrame classes.
- The clock hands (hour, minute, and second) move smoothly and independently, providing a dynamic representation of the time.

# Clear Clock Face:

- The clock face is designed with a clear and simple layout, featuring a white background and easy-to-read numbers at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock.

# Customizable Size:

The clock's size can be adjusted by modifying the width and height, making it adaptable to different layout requirements.

# Usage:

- Run the Application

Execute the Java program to launch the JavaFX analog clock application.
The clock will automatically display the current time and update every second.
- Custom Time Display:

If desired, users can create a ClockPane with specific hour, minute, and second values to display a custom time.
This feature can be utilized for educational purposes or for showcasing a specific time scenario.

# Note:

- This clock application serves as a valuable example of JavaFX's capabilities for creating interactive and visually appealing graphical user interfaces. Whether you're looking to understand JavaFX animation or want to implement a custom analog clock display in your Java application, this repository provides an instructive starting point.

- Enjoy exploring and learning from this JavaFX analog clock application!
